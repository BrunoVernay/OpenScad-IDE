# OpenScad-IDE
An editor for the OpenSCAD language and SVG transpilation with MPS (Meta Programing System)

## Context
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) is a simple and powerful language to create 2D/3D Models Computer-Aided Design (CAD).
Instead of a complex GUI (Blender?) it features a simple language: http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html.

Same concept as PlantUML or UMLet ...

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. It is another world, with tools like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). By transpiling the goals is to bridge the 2 worlds.

Also [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) is worth mentionning, but it is not really scripting oriented, even if there would not be much work to allow it.

## Short term

1. Support a few 2D primitives and some transformations.
2. Support SVG export
3. Improve the concept and apply MPS best practices
